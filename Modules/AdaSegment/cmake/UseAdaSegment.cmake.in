# This file sets up include directories, link directories, and
# compiler settings for a project to use ItkVtkGlue.  It should not be
# included directly, but rather through the ItkVtkGlue_USE_FILE setting
# obtained from ItkVtkGlue.cmake.

# The hints point the find_package to the proper VTK and ITK
