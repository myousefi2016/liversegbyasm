1.5     Made a modification to BiasLearn.cxx, so that the current 
        version is more compatible with VC.

1.4     Fixed one bug in BiasLearn.cxx

1.3     Fixed several bugs in BiasLearn.cxx and segAdapter.cxx. 
        The bugs may cause crushing if the initial segmentation 
        is too close to the edge of the image. The other bug in 
        segAdapter.cxx may cause over producing background labels
        for segmentation problems with multiple labels.
        
        Replaced the option of untouched label in segAdapter.cxx 
        with an option of using exclusion mask. Type
       
        ./sa
        
        to see the detail.
        
        Added the publication describing the software to the 
        package.

1.2	Fixed a bug in the dilation function.

1.1  	Fixed a small bug in the AdaBoost Training algorithm.
	Changed some code for better efficiency.
     	The executable files are compiled under the "Release" mode.

1.0	Initial implmentation compiled under the "Debug" mode.
